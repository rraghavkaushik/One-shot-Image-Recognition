# Facial-Recognition-From-scratch
Implementation of the paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition". 


- In this paper, the authors present a novel approach which limits assumptions on the structure of the inputs while automatically acquir- ing features which enable the model to generalize success- fully from few examples.

An example from the paper is given below:

### WHy Siamese Nets
Large Siamese Convolutional Nets are employed here because
a) are capable of learning generic image features useful for making predictions about unknown class distributions even when very few examples from these new distributions are available
b) are easily trained using standard optimization techniques on pairs sampled from the source data and 
c) provide a competitive approach that does not rely upon domain-specific knowledge by instead exploiting deep learning techniques.
