# Facial-Recognition-From-scratch
Implementation of the paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition"

- In this paper, the authors present a novel approach which limits assumptions on the structure of the inputs while automatically acquir- ing features which enable the model to generalize success- fully from few examples.

An example from the paper is given below:
